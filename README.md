# ros2-labs-00

Repository containing the necessary instructions to install and run ros2 within docker (this repo is not final and may be deleted or grouped with other repositories)

## Topic
This lab serves as preliminary step to install all the necessary tools required for ros2 labs, namely Docker and ROS2

## How to
check the [install_docker_guide.md](https://github.com/c3lab/ros2-labs-00/blob/main/install_docker_guide.md) file. <br>

The main target OS of the course will be Windows as the majority of students usually have that OS.<br>
Dual boot installations of Ubuntu are more than welcome, while support for Mac OS is not tested but if you find any issue we can work on it.
